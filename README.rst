This integrates Chuck Rhode's `PythonTidy` script from
http://pypi.python.org/pypi/PythonTidy/ with the Sublime Text 2 editor.
For as long as there is no download available from PyPI, it uses my
Github fork at https://github.com/witsch/PythonTidy

To reformat your Python source, simply press the keyboard shortcut.  It
is `<ctrl>+<alt>+<cmd>+t` on OSX and `<ctrl>+<alt>+<shift>+t` on Linux
and Windows.
